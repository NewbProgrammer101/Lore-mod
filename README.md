=====================================================================================================================

The entire purpose for this modpack is to add a roguelike feeling to the game, in addition to stories and legends. 
Another one is fighting mobs originating from the classic roguelike games in the default dungeons.
We can add towns consisting of shops. I am very new in the programming field and am a fan of Minetest. Please contribute if you can.
It would be nice if you give me ideas or programming tips as I progress this mod.

This project is very far from finished.

If you forked this modpack, and if you made it better, it's even better to merge it back in here. 

Long story short, do what you want to do in this repository.
