=================================================================

The entire purpose for this modpack is to add a roguelike feeling to the game, in addition to stories and legends. 
Another one is fighting mobs originating from the classic roguelike games in the default dungeons.
We can add towns consisting of shops. I am very new in the programming field and am a fan of Minetest. Please contribute if you can.
It would be nice if you give me ideas or programming tips as I progress this mod.

=================================================================


This project is very far from finished.

If you forked this modpack, and if you made it better, it's even better to merge it back in here. 

Long story short, do what you want to do in this repository.

Overall TODO list:

- Add a messaging system, i.e. "There is a kobold wielding leather armor and a dagger." (Cool, but optional)

- Learn Lua.

- Add lore, folklore, legends, books with stories, spellbooks.

- Fix tons of stuff along the way.

- Merge roomgen mod into this repository.

dungeon-crawl TODO list: 

- Make new spawn.lua

- Add weapons, armor, scrolls with random labels, potions, and levels.

nethack TODO list:

- Add mobs.

- Add nethack-only items.

- Add orcish mines, and make orcs spawn in it.

catacomb TODO list:

- Add tons of new custom rooms i.e. the Big Room from nethack.

- Add lots of new nodes.

Noob questions:

- How do I add a repository to this repository? I'm trying to add the roomgen repository to the current one.

- How do I add .png files to this repository?
