Textures for nodes to be in dungeons.


The dungeon dresser needs some improvements in regards to appearance.

There will be tables, candles, jail doors, etc. All kinds of things that are in roguelike games.

You can help too! Put anything related to roguelikes and minetest in the commits.

I will accept legitimate pull requests.
